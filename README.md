## My process

I Managed to finished this project for 3 hours. I understand the card concept now but I still don't know how the background property works so I need to update this challenge when I learn about background property in CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge I tried to use CSS Variables property and I managed to do that, it makes your code cleaner and I like that.

```css
:root{
    --dark-cyan: hsl(185, 75%, 39%);
    --dark-blue: hsl(229, 23%, 23%);
    --gray-blue: hsl(227, 10%, 46%);
    --dark-gray: hsl(0, 0%, 59%);
}
```

### Continued development

I'm gonna update this pages when I learn about background property in CSS.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Variables - w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp) - This helped me for understanding CSS Variables and it's pretty straightforward.
